# Comp340-production

## Component locations:
Saving system located in ShadersNew/Assets/scripts/savingSystem.cs
cell shader located in _TestBuild/Assets/Resources/Shaders/CellShader_Outline
Main menu functionality in _TestBuild/assets/Scripts/MenuFunctionality.cs

## Other notes:
Because our game got re scoped so many times, and the requirements changed, a lot of what I worked on, never actually got implemented into the final game, and what I did work on was fairly trivial.
